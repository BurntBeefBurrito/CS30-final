# Major project proposal
Wait how do I rename the repository

## Description
I want to polish the original rhythm game scraps that I made (scene in my original repository) and add to it

## Needs to have
- charts/maps for notes
  - I do not want randomized note spawns as they would be incredibly unfun in my eyes
- two songs and associated charts
- menus for picking a song, settings, credits for musicians and inspirations, and instructions
  - the settings menu will include volume, hitsounds and likely other settings
- a basic tutorial
- an additional program for charting support
  - this is so that I can create maps without losing my sanity
- basic "flavour" to make hitting notes feel responsive and rewarding (audio and visual reactions)
- a funny name for the rhythm game itself

## Nice to have
- easter eggs (out of season)
  - whats a good game without easter eggs or secrets?
- a chart for additional mechanics, to overcomplicate what could be simple gameplay
  - this could include 
- another map for adding visual effects, to make the game more pleasing to the eye than simply just vertically moving notes
  - by pleasing to the eye, I mean something which will require me to add an epilepsy warning
- scoring (to compete with other people)
  - I could also possibly expand on this with an online scoring thing, DO NOT count on me implementing this
- a "fever meter" which you fill up by hitting notes and activate to temporarily increase point gains
  - I believe guitar hero had something like this or maybe rock band
- limbo keys https://youtu.be/ryBbuH_SPbs?t=188
