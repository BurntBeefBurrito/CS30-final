# Major project proposal

## Description
I want to polish the original rhythm game scraps that I made (scene in my original repository) and add to it

## Needs to have
- charts/maps for notes
- two songs and associated charts
- menus for picking a song, settings, credits for musicians and inspirations, and instructions
- a basic tutorial
- an additional program for charting support
- basic "flavour" to make hitting notes feel responsive and rewarding (audio and visual reactions)

## Nice to have
- easter eggs (out of season)
- a chart for additional mechanics, to overcomplicate what could be simple gameplay
- another map for adding visual effects, to make the game more pleasing to the eye than simply just vertically moving notes
- scoring (to compete with other people)
