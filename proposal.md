# Major project proposal
Wait how do I rename the repository

## Description
I want to polish the original rhythm game scraps that I made (scene in my original repository) and add to it

## Needs to have
- music
- charts/maps for notes
  - I do not want randomized note spawns as they would be incredibly unfun in my opinion
- two songs and associated charts
  - this is core to gameplay
- menus for picking a song
- a basic tutorial, effectively a third song
  - this will serve as a tutorial and also as a first map for practicing map making
- an additional program for charting support
  - this is so that I can create maps without losing my sanity
- basic "flavour" to make hitting notes feel responsive and rewarding (audio and visual reactions)
  - the cues will be less satisfying if your hits are less on beat
- a funny name for the rhythm game itself
  - this is absolutely necessary, trust me


## Nice to have
- easter eggs (out of season)
  - whats a good game without easter eggs or secrets?
- a chart for additional mechanics, to overcomplicate what could be simple gameplay
  - this could include notes that lose score when hit, notes that cover your screen when hit, or hiding all the notes altogether ;)
- another map for adding visual effects, to make the game more pleasing to the eye than simply just vertically moving notes
  - by pleasing to the eye, I mean something which will require me to add an epilepsy warning
  - I may add an option to disable this if I see it as possibly harmful to some
- scoring (to compete/compare with other people)
  - I could also possibly expand on this with an online scoring thing, DO NOT count on me implementing this
- a "fever meter" which you fill up by hitting notes and activate to temporarily increase point gains
  - I believe guitar hero had something like this or maybe rock band
- menus for settings, credits for musicians and inspirations
  - the settings menu will include volume, hitsounds and likely other settings
- chatgpt integration (nathans recommendation)
- custom made sprites for bumpers, notes, etc
- limbo keys https://youtu.be/ryBbuH_SPbs?t=188 (flashy colours warning)

## Credits/inspirations (awesome colour warning for the linked videos)
- Make it funky now modchart on osu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQsBAXkgm04
- Limbo from geometry dash https://youtu.be/ryBbuH_SPbs?t=15
- Dancedance revolution as a whole
