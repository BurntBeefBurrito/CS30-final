## What advice would I have given myself?
- MAKE SURE VSCODE EXTENSIONS WORK BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
- Learn more random things that aren't directly part of whats normally taught
- Try to memorise the names of your own variables
- dont overestimate your time in class

## What was the hardest part? Or as I'll interpret it; what parts were challenging, but still got solved?
- Understanding VScode and Githubs quirks, since I might have lost a bit of code over time while working at home a bit
- A close second had to have been basic mathematics, like for the map writers "scrollbar" at the right, or note speed, I swear I forgot algebra

## Did I complete everything in my need to have list?
Nope, although I could have easily had them done with
In regards to how things went, we got:
- Music :D
- no charts/maps for the songs :(
- A 4/5ths baked song picking menu, but it could easily be implemented :I
- Did not make the 2 main songs, or tutorial, :(
- A program for charting support :D
- in terms of having flavour (see proposal), it appears we a re working with British cuisine :(
- I called the thing SASS (But why? You may never know) :)

## Were there any problems that I couldn't solve?
Yep, I couldn't end up figuring out ESLint on my own computer, leading to so much frustration that admittedly led me to
give up on my project. I simply could not see myself working on the project for as long as there weren't any convenient 
little red underlines telling me when I made an error. 

##What things am I proud of?
- I'm proud of my map writing system, despite it being incredibly scuffed
- I figured out how to open images, and other information from folders in a quirky way using eval
- I think in terms of learning, I learned a lot, but accomplishing stuff on the other hand...
- I didn't need any sort of tutorials, only explanations for things I didn't fully understand

##Misc comments/regrets
- I didn't get the thing together enough to ask for input from others
- I want to fix the thing over the summer, and tie up a lot of loose ends
- I'm really upset that I didn't put the time to fix ESLint with a wrench or something because this legitimately couldve been amazing
- I got so sidetracked in the side stuff that I didn't end up making the actual rhythm game
- Also I'm REALLY self conscious about the music I listen to so this is all kinda a gamble

##TLDR
I drastically underestimated the time requirement for the projects side stuff
