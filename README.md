# CS30-final, Rhythm game "SASS"
https://burntbeefburrito.github.io/CS30-final/scene/ may be the link you're looking for
It's composed of a Rhythm game and mapping program for said rhythm game.
INCOMPLETE DUE TO A DIRE LOSS OF ESLINT WHEN I WANTED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT
Please check out https://burntbeefburrito.github.io/CS30-final/writer/ for the
mapping tool that I spent a bunch of time writing for my main project. I hope someone 
else could learn from all those mistakes... ...they keep me awake :)
